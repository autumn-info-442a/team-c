**Team Name:** Team Childcare

**Mission Statement:** Enriching child social development in a virtual world.

**Problem Statement:**
Before everything went virtual, students were accustomed to attending gatherings in-person. Since the pandemic hit in March, students are forced to stay home and learn online on their own, with parents stepping up as temporary teachers. For students in grades K-6, this greatly affects their cognitive, non-cognitive, and social abilities since their environment has now drastically changed in their earlier years of life. Most of these skills cannot be solely taught by parents, and social distancing can be particularly difficult for some children. As children get older and more socially adept, friends and peers become increasingly essential for their social development compared to their immediate families. In a time where support is needed most, children have limited options as to how they can gain that assistance, especially since they likely feel much lonelier now than before.
